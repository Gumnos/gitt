Through reading about their day to day lives, the reader will learn not only how to use Git, but why version control systems are important and how to implement
                            them within an organisation.</p></td><td class="fade_right">&nbsp;</td>

Currently the book is written in LaTeX, but it isn't hard to learn. You can see the source files in plain text and edit them quite easily. Also, we are looking for situations in which you may have found yourself whilst using Git, whether you managed to resolve them or not. GITT is rather scenario based sometimes, so we need situations in which to place the employees at Tamagoyaki Inc. Spelling fixes are always welcome, as are general comments on the 
                        text itself.</p>
