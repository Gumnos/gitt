General spelling check/grammer check
Sanity on git commands check
I think I am using 1.7.1 Git
	Need to figure out what is in 1.7.4 if there are any differences

Get vetting from someone on the history of version control systems
Come up with more breakout boxes :)
Come up with more items for terminology

%git log -p

%git show master:<path>
%git diff -- stylesheet.css master:stylesheet.css

% git show v1.0.0^{tree}

%wmctrl -r Gui -e 0,0,0,811,500

Neeeed to talk about .gitignore

Create and place nice icons in top left corner of breakout boxes
