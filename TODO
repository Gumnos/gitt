All great points from ali1234 - will be taken care of when I re-rev early chaps
 1. what is the name of the CEO and why is he so angry? he is too much of a stereotype...
 2. also, what about the product or the customer? adding background like this would help to set the story
 3. by day 4 everyone is in unanimous agreement that git is the best thing ever. how about having a character who is a bit skeptical?
 4. you're starting sentences with "so," and "in this way," a bit too much, it's noticable. you can use them, but try to cut some of them out.
