\section{Day 1 - ``Give a man a patch''}
\subsection{Collaborating with outsiders}

We have spoken at great length now about rebasing and have seen that it is a very very powerful tool.
It can form part of your workflow in your development cycle.
However, always heed that warning that should send alarm bells ringing in the back of your mind about rebasing.
Rebasing changes the past. Rebasing changes history.
As such, it should be used a) with caution, and b) only by people who understand exactly what they are doing.

We are going to leave rebasing for a while now, take a quick look at a feature you really should know about
and then focus on some of the more advanced features of Git.
The following situation occurs fairly regularly for some people.

\begin{trenches}
John was stroking his chin and looking pensively out of the window when Simon approached his desk.
The manager hadn't seen him yet and Simon instinctively swayed a little back and forth, try to make himself known in as subtle a way as possible.
Klaus, who was watching from the corner of his eye took a more direct approach.
He took the out of date org chart down from the office divider, screwed it up into a ball and launched it at John's head.
It struck the manager squarely in the jaw causing him to almost tip from his awkwardly balanced chair.

John noticed Simon standing there and looked a little surprised.
He then noticed Klaus and in an instant understood the chain of events that had just taken place.
``Sorry Simon,'' started John, ``I've been trying to figure out a problem all morning.''

``It's no problem.''  Simon pulled up a chair and sat down. ``I was wondering if you had a few minutes to discuss Luigi?''

``Well as Luigi is a contractor, he's not going to get access to our repository here to perform commits directly.
And he doesn't have the capability, nor do I really want him, making our code available on the internet.
But he does have a clone of our repository from last week.'' John understood the problem.

``Right!''

``Have you heard of patching in Git?'' asked John.

Simon looked at his shoes, ``Can't say I have John, sorry.''  

John smiled, ``No worrys. What we can do is get Luigi to generate a patch of his changes.
We can then take that patch and apply it to our codebase.  Luigi can then just reset his clone when he comes into the office.''
Simon nodded as John continued, ``Go and ask Martha about it.  I think she's pretty hot on these types of things.''

Klaus giggled, ``Think she's hot eh John?''

The paper was returned.
